    <input class="theme-toggle" type="checkbox" /><section><h2>The toggle</h2><p>I made a fancy looking toggle switch that can switch from day to night.
Originally, I made it to be used as toggle for switching between dark and light mode for a website from work.
However, in the end we didn&#39;t use it because it was <em>too</em>fancy which didn&#39;t match the overall style.
In HTML the toggle is just <code class="code-inline">&lt;input class=&quot;theme-toggle&quot; type=&quot;checkbox&quot; /&gt;</code>. All the
styling and animation is done (ab)using CSS. It could maybe use some cleaning up, but I am not interested
on working on it anymore :) Still, I find it pretty unique so I wanted to show it off.
</p><p>Apart from the stars everything is drawn using circles. The round button (sun or moon) is a square CSS pseudo-element
that had its corners rounded to make it a circle. Every other circle is a just a box shadow of this element.
The stars are created with another pseudo-element where the contents are a Unicode symbol ðŸŸ„ (U+1F7C4).
That star is then copied using box shadows.
