Originally, I made it to be used for switching between dark and light mode for a work related website. However, in the end we didn't use it because it was _too_ fancy which didn't match the overall style. In HTML the toggle is just <code>&lt;input class=&quot;theme-toggle&quot; type=&quot;checkbox&quot; /&gt;</code>.</p><p>All the styling and animation is done (ab)using CSS. It could use some cleaning up, but I am not interested on working on it anymore 😅 Still, I find it pretty unique so I wanted to show it off. Apart from the stars everything is drawn using circles. The round button (sun or moon) is a square CSS pseudo-element that had its corners rounded to make it a circle. Every other circle is a just a box shadow of this element. The stars are created with another pseudo-element where the contents are a Unicode symbol 🟄 (U+1F7C4). That star is then copied using box shadows.</p><h2>Browser differences</h2><div class="gallery"><figure><img src="/assets/chrome_box_shadow.png" alt="Render of the toggle in Chrome" width="373" height="373"><figcaption>Render of the toggle in Chrome.

Chrome annoyingly stopped rendering the dark circle of the moon at certain zoom levels. But what I found really interesting is that the two browsers determine box shadow shapes differently! Firefox renders the bigger box shadows of the circle as bigger circles, where as Chrome renders the bigger box shadows as bigger squares with rounded corners. I don't know if there is an official spec for this, but I find Firefox's behaviour to be more intuitive. I expect the shape of the box shadow to be the same as the shape of the source element.</p></article></main></div><footer><ul class="contact-information"><li><a class="main-link" href="https://www.github.com/toteload">Github</a></li><li><a class="main-link" href="mailto:me@davidbos.me">email address</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
