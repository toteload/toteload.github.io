            Hello, my name is David Bos (often go by toteload online) and this is my website!
            The guy on the right is an artistic rendition of me. 
            My nose is not actually that big in real life.

        <p>
            I like video games, art, programming, puzzles and everything in between.
            Programming-wise my interests mainly lie in programming language design, compilers,
            low level optimization and ray tracing. 
            But many other things I also like :)
        </p>
        <p>
            Check out some of <a href="/posts.html">my posts</a>! There should be at least one.
