First, the ideas presented are not fleshed out, and it could be that they are not doable when you try to implement things.
They are vague ideas or features for a programming language.

The philosophy behind the ideas is improving safety by stricter compiler checking and letting a programmer express relations between data rather
than restricting allowable actions in a language.

I start with shortly explaining what I mean with refinement types and a TypeScript-like type system followed by a few examples of what these features
could enable a programmer to express. 

## What is a refinement type?

A [refinement type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refinement_type) is a type with a a predicate attached to it that holds for every value of this type.

Rust is not a language that has user-definable refinement types, but you can find some examples of refinements in the standard library, like `NonZero` and `NonNull`.
The [documentation for NonZero](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/num/struct.NonZero.html) mentions that `NonZero` can result in memory optimization.
For example, `Option<NonZero<u32>>` is the same size as `u32` because the compiler is able to use 0 to mean `None`. 
This is great! However, I think it is a shame that it is not possible to describe such optimizations ourselves.
It is not uncommon to have integer variables where not every value is valid.
The excess values could be used for something else, but you cannot express this.

[Wuffs](https://github.com/google/wuffs) is a memory-safe programming language that does have refinement types.
Wuffs is a small language and meant to write decoders and encoders in.
It is safe with respect to buffer overflows, integer arithmetic overflows and null pointer dereferences.
All these checks are done at _compile time_.
For integer variables the compiler understands what values it can have and thus if addition might result in an overflow or not.

## What is a TypeScript-like type system?

[Flow-sensitive typing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow-sensitive_typing) (or flow typing) is something I came into contact with at work using [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).
A type system with flow typing can refine the type of a variable through the flow of a program.

Below is a documented Typescript snippet to showcase flow typing and union types.
You can run it in the TypeScript playground [here](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play/?#code/C4TwDgpgBAcgrgWwEYQE4HlUGVioJYB2A5lALxQGIqpQA+UAzroUQNwBQ7AZnAQMbA8AewJQA7gAsAhsACSDWcAAUADwBcsKmkw58xAJRQA3uyhQA9OagBBYFGAS8DKGCGE7KqHyFwANgBMoFCgpCi0aIRpQpj0iABpGQj5oMWhpADdoAiFgUwsrQgZIAQhAzxAIYAA6TjM8LiglUEghBs9SDqgAchiWLsMTMzNLKFlRBycg1Cl+CSgAFXAIBj58MDtefzQmGf9nBxkoTz4ZqBFfECDoaOZiGryzbwIGIV8IKt8hIiUuz0mb2L9DhDKCoSpwVAEYFQAC+tXyowaqVBECkfDmE2crnc9gkEFEnjEUmc2TsAJYCReRy8p3Ol2CoUoyDQNWGVkWkBWazs-yQb3sQkYzDALikqDsrVx0Ga0AYSRS0EgqC4kQQpRCoN4gjVXjxfAA1nkRsBBVJfJ8xLinKx7MtBMQoPUpfYlmc2o7nOSHZEKDl7nUGk0lpL2p0ukzqP1jA8vCIXm8Pl8fn9PWFmaggTGwcAIVC8nCjVZZEjoGC0RjHFi3AQ7A58dSiSSIHg61EhbFfW2I2g4oXxI50YwJD4AhQIJkaNIwJBRE66y5UF9pggPeIIOaXZB-P6EQRx2hV9FingzZv3n3FFA1TN9tI7NkzuthKIIConMBnJLJIdMWfY35AhQHcRmLNcoH8PBAlJKBX2kOAmDwTILl1CADRgidLlcBg5T5aB0jFE8az7A4PH-UdgjrcY8RCbC8CIAg1RrK4LXEEdAOuM8+3RVD9RYGDUEXVAqigABNHwaXGVBLl-EAfFQBh1waJBLgQKReOIPt4HTHRbhIchuxoehegdegkCEV5UQIVlY2eOwAH1YKkeDBEyPdsIAYT1fUND3CcyCODgL1EUIwEXJVkJlQJQqXKQV1-BhhwAsc-NC9xrKeeN3k+b4ACIAHU7ygDJoFkuBwJECAAH4AEIcv0DgCwyuwQA0LTqB0jtyC6PFzSELoOG-OQFGUEB6s4EZ5krVcOQgLBVjwdYoBVGgcoAMTgNDSuEgARQVBtGW0N1KgVyqqHL2EG+RFCULgzQUmioF4fVsjEYLnDa7RsF0+qgA).

```typescript
type NumberOrString = number | string;

function whatIsIt(x: NumberOrString) {
  // At this point x could be a number or a string, since we have not
  // inspected x yet.

  if (typeof x === 'string') {
    // In this branch Typescript understands that x can only be a string.

    console.log('x is a string');
    return;
  }

  // If we reach this point then x was not a string, so x can only be a number.
  // Typescript is able to strip part of the type since we performed a runtime check
  // to allow this; testing if the type of x is a string or not.

  if (typeof x === 'number') {
    console.log('x is a number');
    return;
  }

  // If we reach this point then x was neither a string nor a number,
  // which should never happen if the program is well typed.

  // Below is an assignment to a variable with type never.
  // never is a special type.
  // It means that no option exists of what this type could be.

  // If we did not exhaustively check every possible variant
  // that x could be then the assignment below would be a type
  // checking error. You can try this yourself by making
  // NumberOrString = number | string | boolean
  const _exhaustivenessCheck: never = x;

  // In a properly typed program this should never print.
  console.log("What have you done?!");
}

const y: NumberOrString = 'hello';
whatIsIt(y);

// This is TypeScript for "Frick you. Just do the type cast."
whatIsIt(false as unknown as NumberOrString);
```

## Application to existing work

There is a [PyPy blog post](https://morepypy.blogspot.com/2015/01/faster-more-memory-efficient-and-more.html) explaining their then new dictionary design (it's a post from 2015).
Their design is not important here, just know that it uses an array of integers (`sparse_array`) as indices into another array (`compact_array`).
The value of the indices can only be as large as the size of the dictionary (`num_items`).
So, if the dictionary has fewer than 255 entries, then using 8-bit indices is sufficient.
When the dictionary grows beyond this size you would need at least 16-bit integers, etc.

```c
struct dict {
    long num_items;
    variable_int *sparse_array;
    dict_entry *compact_array;
}
```

This means that the *actual* type (a 8-bit, 16-bit or 32-bit integer) of `variable_int` depends on the value of `num_items`.
You cannot express this relationship between variables in C or C++, but you could in a TypeScript-like C.

```
type small_dict = struct {
    u32(0..(2**8)) num_items;
    u8 *sparse_array;
    dict_entry *compact_array;
};

type medium_dict = struct {
    u32((2**8)..(2**16)) num_items;
    u16 *sparse_array;
    dict_entry *compact_array;
};

type big_dict = struct {
    u32((2**16)..(2**32)) num_items;
    u32 *sparse_array;
    dict_entry *compact_array;
};

type dict = small_dict | medium_dict | big_dict;
```

In the example the `dict` comes in three variaties with either 8-bit, 16-bit or 32-bit indices.
You can differentiate between the three by inspecting the value of `num_items`.
The syntax of `u32(lo..hi)` is a meant as a refinement on `u32`, where its value must lie in the range `lo..hi`.

You still have to check at runtime what kind of dictionary you are dealing with, but you would have to do this anyway.
This does not incur extra cost, but the compiler can check if you are not accidentally assuming you are dealing
with a `small_dict` without having done the necessary checks.

Other examples that also fall into the category of different interpretation of memory depending on some bit of data are
NaN-boxing and Small String Optimization (SSO).

## Other bits

### Safely growing a vector

This example requires a little bit more context than the other examples.

```rust
let mut a: Vec<i32> = Vec::with_capacity(8);

a.push(1);
a.push(2);
a.push(3);

let b: &i32 = &a[0];

a.push(4); // <- Very naughty!
```

In Rust it is illegal to hold a reference to a `Vec` element and then push an element.
You are holding an immutable reference and then try to mutably borrow it.
However, this is safe if the push does not trigger a reallocation.
Even if you check for this you are not allowed to push while holding a reference.
Annoying!

If you could overload a function based on a refinement, then you could define a version of `push` that does not require a mutable borrow!
That is a big if, but a man can dream.

```rust
fn push(&self, x: T) where self.len < self.cap {
    // Party time! We can push x without having to reallocate.
    // ...
}

fn push(&mut self, x: T) {
    // ...
}
```

### Alignment through address refinement

Alignment requirements can be expressed through refinement predicates on addresses.
In the pseudocode `address` is an implicitly available variable that represents the address value of a value of the type. 

```
type Int64 = [8]u8 where (address % 8 == 0);
```

Maybe on some embedded systems you have ranges of memory that are reserved for certain purposes.
For example, the Game Boy has 8 KiB of VRAM mapped to memory range 0x8000-0xA000.
It is possible to define pointers that are only allowed to point to VRAM.

```
type VRAMByte = u8 where (address >= 0x8000 && address < 0xA000);
type VRAMPointer = *VRAMByte;
```

If the program is well typed, you could never accidentally read or write outside of VRAM when using a `VRAMPointer`.

## Bending the rules

OK so everything is safe and stuff. Great!

## Afterthoughts

What I like about this conceptual programming language is that it is not a big
departure from conventional imperative languages, while still allowing the programmer
to express their intent more precisely.
I have not seen a programming language that is quite like this, and I think this allows you to express some
