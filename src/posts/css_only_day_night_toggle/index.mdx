## The toggle

I made a fancy toggle switch that can switch from day to night
(enlarged on this page so you can see it better). Originally, I made it to be
used for switching between dark and light mode for a work related website.
However, in the end we didn't use it because it was _too_ fancy which didn't
match the overall style. In HTML the toggle is just `<input class="theme-toggle" type="checkbox" />`.
All the styling and animation is done (ab)using CSS. It could use some
cleaning up, but I am not interested on working on it anymore ðŸ˜… Still, I find
it pretty unique so I wanted to show it off. Apart from the stars everything is
drawn using circles. The round button (sun or moon) is a square CSS
pseudo-element that had its corners rounded to make it a circle. Every other
circle is a just a box shadow of this element. The stars are created with
another pseudo-element where the contents are a Unicode symbol ðŸŸ„ (U+1F7C4). That
star is then copied using box shadows. If you don't see a four-pointed star,
then your browser font doesn't include this symbol. Sorry!

## Browser differences

I tested the toggle in Firefox and Chrome, and found some differences. Chrome
annoyingly stopped rendering the dark circle of the moon at certain zoom levels.
But what I found really interesting is that the two browsers determine box
shadow shapes differently! Firefox renders the bigger box shadows of the circle
as bigger circles, where as Chrome renders the bigger box shadows as bigger
squares with rounded corners. I don't know if there is an official spec for
this, but I find Firefox's behaviour to be more intuitive. I expect the shape of
the box shadow to be the same as the shape of the source element. In the image
above you can drag the divider to see the difference between Chrome (left) and
Firefox (right).
