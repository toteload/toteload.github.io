      Hello, my name is David Bos and this is my website! The drawing is an
      artistic rendition of me. The receding hairline is accurate, but my nose
      is not actually that big in real life. It's even bigger.

      I like video games, visual art, programming, puzzles and everything in
      between. Programming-wise my interests are mainly graphics- and game
      programming, compilers and interpreters, but also programming language
      design. But really I find almost everything game and computer related
      interesting ðŸ˜„
